For robots with many sensors and actuators, ANNs can be very complex, with many neurons and connections. Removal of neurons or connections, i.e., pruning, may be desirable because (i) it reduces the complexity of the ANN, making its operation more energy efficient, and (ii) it might improve the generalization ability of the ANN. Whether these goals can actually be achieved in practice is however still not well known. On the other hand, it is widely recognized that pruning in biological neural networks plays a fundamental role in the development of brains and their ability to learn. In this work, we consider the case of Voxel-based Soft Robots, a kind of robots where sensors and actuators are distributed over the body and that can be controlled with ANNs optimized by means of neuroevolution. We experimentally characterize the effect of different forms of pruning on the effectiveness of neuroevolution, also in terms of generalization ability of the evolved ANNs. We find that, with some forms of pruning, a large portion of the connections can be pruned without strongly affecting robot capabilities. We also observe sporadic improvements in generalization ability."},{"n":"02","id":"nadizar2022merging","title":"Merging Pruning and Neuroevolution: towards Robust and Efficient Controllers for Modular Soft Robots","author":"G.

Their structure is often complex, with many neurons and connections, especially when the robots have many sensors and actuators distributed across their bodies and/or when high expressive power is desirable. Pruning (removing neurons or connections) reduces the complexity of the ANN, thus increasing its energy efficiency, and has been reported to improve the generalization capability, in some cases. In addition, it is well-known that pruning in biological neural networks plays a fundamental role in the development of brains and their ability to learn. In this work, we consider the evolutionary optimization of neural controllers for the case study of Voxel-based Soft Robots, a kind of modular, bio-inspired soft robots, applying pruning during fitness evaluation. For a locomotion task, and for centralized as well as distributed controllers, we experimentally characterize the effect of different forms of pruning on after-pruning effectiveness, life-long effectiveness, adaptability to new terrains, and behavior.

In this paper, we employ a evolutionary approach to optimize the development—according to different representations—of Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs), a kind of modular robots. In our study, development consists in the addition of new voxels to the VSR, at fixed time instants, depending on the development schedule.

Here we attempt an experimental investigation of the reciprocal effects of the human-ALife interaction. To this extent, we design an artificial world populated by life-like creatures, and resort to open-ended evolution to foster the creatures adaptation. We allow bidirectional communication between the system and humans, who can observe the artificial world and voluntarily choose to perform positive or negative actions towards the creatures populating it; those actions may have a short- or long-term impact on the artificial creatures. Our experimental results show that the creatures are capable of evolving under the influence of humans, even though the impact of the interaction remains uncertain.

Those sub-problems are then tackled concurrently by evolving one population of solutions—actually, <i>components</i> of a larger solution—for each of them. However, components cannot be evaluated in isolation: in the common case of two concurrently evolving populations, each solution of one population must be coupled with another solution of the other population (the <i>collaborator</i>) in order to compute the fitness of the pair. Previous studies have already shown that the way collaborators are chosen and, if more than one is chosen, the way the resulting fitness measures are aggregated, play a key role in determining the success of coevolution. In this paper we perform an experimental analysis aimed at shedding new light on the effects of collaborators selection and aggregation. We first propose a general scheme for cooperative coevolution of two populations that allows to (a) different EAs and solution representations on the two sub-problems and to (b) set different collaborators selection and aggregation strategies. Second, we instantiate this general scheme in a few variants and apply it to four optimization problems with different degrees of separability: two toy problems and two real prediction problems tackled with different kinds of model (symbolic regression and neural networks). We analyze the outcomes in terms of (a) effectiveness and efficiency of the optimization and (b) complexity and generalization power of the solutions. We find that the degree to which selection and aggregation schemes differ strongly depends on the interaction between the components of the solution."},{"n":"10","id":"nadizar2023investigation","title":"An Investigation of Geometric Semantic GP with Linear Scaling","author":"G.

GSGP uses geometric semantic genetic operators, different from the standard ones, without altering the fitness, while LS modifies the fitness without altering the genetic operators. So far, these two methods have already been joined together in only one practical application. However, to the best of our knowledge, a methodological study on the pros and cons of integrating these two methods has never been performed. In this paper, we present a study of GSGP-LS, a system that integrates GSGP and LS. The results, obtained on five hand-tailored benchmarks and six real-life problems, indicate that GSGP-LS outperforms GSGP in the majority of the cases, confirming the expected benefit of this integration. However, for some particularly hard datasets, GSGP-LS overfits training data, being outperformed by GSGP on unseen data. Additional experiments using standard GP, with and without LS, confirm this trend also when standard crossover and mutation are employed. This contradicts the idea that LS is always beneficial for GP, warning the practitioners about its risk of overfitting in some specific cases."},{"n":"11","id":"nadizar2023fully","title":"A Fully-distributed Shape-aware Neural Controller for Modular Robots","author":"G.

In this work, we address such shortcoming by proposing a shape-aware modular controller, operating with (1) <i>self-discovery</i> phase, in which each module controller identifies the shape it is assembled in, followed by (2) <i>parameter selection</i> phase, where the controller selects its parameters according to the inferred shape. We deploy a self-classifying neural cellular automaton for phase (1), and we leverage evolutionary optimization for implementing a library of controller parameters for phase (2). We test the validity of the proposed method considering voxel-based soft robots, a class of modular soft robots, and the task of locomotion.

We use genetic programming (GP) for solving this optimization problem. Namely, we employ a multi-tree-based GP variant, where a candidate solution is an array of m trees, each encoding a univariate function of the agent observation. We compare this form of optimization against the more common one where the controller is a multi-layer perceptron, with a predefined topology, whose weights are optimized through (neuro)evolution (NE). Moreover, we consider an evolutionary algorithm, GraphEA, that directly evolves graphs, each having n input nodes and m output nodes. We apply these three approaches to the case of simulated modular soft robots, where a robot is an aggregation of identical soft modules, each employing a controller that processes the local observation and produces the local action. We find that, in our scenario, multi-tree-based GP is competitive with NE and tends to produce different behaviors. We then experimentally investigate the possibility of optimizing a controller using another, pre-optimized one, as teacher, i.e., we realize a form of offline imitation learning. We consider all the teacher-learner pairs resulting from the three evolutionary algorithms and find that NE is a better learner than GP and GraphEA. However, controllers obtained through offline imitation learning are far less effective than those obtained through direct evolution. We hypothesize that this gap in effectiveness may be explained by the possibility, given by direct evolution, of exploring during the simulations a larger portion of the observation-action space."},{"n":"13","id":"nadizar2023neural","title":"Neural Cellular Automata Enable Self-Discovery of Physical Configuration in Modular Robots Driven by Collective Intelligence","author":"G.

One observation is that artificial neural networks with state may be able to cope with the dynamical nature of VSR bodies and their morphological computation. In this work, we consider four types of controllers, i.e., multilayer perceptrons (MLPs, stateless), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) without homeostasis, and SNNs with homeostasis. We consider three robot morphologies tested for locomotion, where each morphology is investigated in simulation with three different types and number of sensors. Neural network controllers are optimized with neuroevolution, and the experimental results are compared in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization ability. In addition, we analyze the resulting behavior of the robots systematically. Our results show that RNNs are typically more effective while MLPs are often the weakest controllers, particularly for robots with few sensors. However, SNNs are more capable in terms of generalization and the mechanism of homeostasis is often beneficial. Finally, we show that RNNs and SNNs with homeostasis produce a more wide variety of behaviors."},{"n":"15","id":"nadizar2023grammatical","title":"A Grammatical Evolution Approach to the Automatic Inference of P Systems","author":"G.

Despite their relevance for both theoretical and application scenarios, the design and the identification of P systems remain tedious and demanding tasks, requiring considerable time and expertise. In this work, we try to address these problems by proposing an automated methodology based on Grammatical Evolution (GE)—an evolutionary computation technique—which does not require any domain knowledge. We consider a setting where observations of successive configurations of a P system are available, and we rely on GE for automatically inferring the P system, i.e., its ruleset. Such approach directly addresses the identification problem, but it can also be employed for automated design, requiring the designer to simply express the configurations of the P system rather than its full ruleset. We assess the practicability of the proposed method on six problems of various difficulties and evaluate its behavior in terms of inference capability and time consumption. Experimental results confirm our approach is a viable strategy for small problem sizes, where it achieves perfect inference in a few seconds without any human intervention. Moreover, we also obtain promising results for larger problem sizes in a human-aided context, paving the way for fully- or partially-automated design of P systems."},{"n":"16","id":"medvet2023evolutionary","title":"Evolutionary Machine Learning in Robotics\n","author":"E.

While this freedom makes modular robots capable of performing different tasks, finding the optimal physical configuration for a given task is not trivial. In fact, practitioners attempt to jointly optimize the body and the controller of the robot for a given task, but the result is not always satisfactory. More broadly, it is not clear what factors make a physical configuration more or less successful. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and verify if humans can be predictive with respect to the performance of an optimized controller for a given robot body. We consider the case of Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs), whose rich dynamic induced by the softness of the modules makes the body particularly relevant for the robot ability to perform a task. We instantiate a number of (simulated) VSR bodies, differing in shape and actuation mechanism, and let a panel of humans control them, by means of online interaction with the simulator, while performing the task of locomotion. We use the same bodies with controllers obtained with evolutionary optimization, for the same task. We compare the ranking of human- and optimized AI-based VSRs, finding them very similar. We believe that our results strengthen the hypothesis that intrinsic factors in the body of modular robots determine their success."},{"n":"18","id":"nadizar2024naturally","title":"Naturally Interpretable Control Policies via Graph-based Genetic Programming","author":"G.

Genetic programming (GP) has been used to obtain interpretable ML models because it operates at the level of functional building blocks: if these building blocks are interpretable, there is a chance that their composition (i.e., the entire ML model) is also interpretable. However, the degree to which a model is interpretable depends on the observer. Motivated by this, we study a recently-introduced human-in-the-loop system that allows the user to steer GP’s generation process to their preferences, which shall be online-learned by an artificial neural network (ANN). We focus on the generation of ML models as analytical functions (i.e., symbolic regression) as this is a key problem in interpretable ML, and propose a two-fold contribution. First, we devise more general representations for the ML models for the ANN to learn upon, to enable the application of the system to a wider range of problems. Second, we delve into a deeper analysis of the system’s components. To this end, we propose an incremental experimental evaluation, aimed at studying the effectiveness by which an ANN can capture the perceived interpretability for simulated users,investigating how the GP’s outcome is affected across different simulated user feedback profiles, anddetermining whether humans participants would prefer models that were generated with or without their involvement.\nOur results pose clarity on pros and cons of using a human-in-the-loop approach to discover interpretable ML models with GP."},{"n":"20","id":"nadizar2024interpretable","title":"Interpretable Control of Modular Soft Robots","author":"G.

In this paper we propose an advancement, GSGP with Lamarckian LS (GSGP-LLS), wherein we update the individuals in the population with their scaling coefficients in a Lamarckian fashion, i.e., by inheritance of acquired traits.    We assess GSGP-LS and GSGP-LLS against standard GSGP for the task of symbolic regression on five hand-tailored benchmarks and six real-life problems.

Using a highly customisable task, we investigate how various factors, including environmental conditions (i.e., the arena configuration), agent perception (i.e., the robot sensors), controller design (i.e., the structure of the artificial neural network controlling the robot), and fitness shaping (i.e., how the robot is rewarded for its behaviour) influence the ruggedness of the fitness landscape. Our findings suggest that simple measures can be sufficiently informative of the ruggedness of a given fitness landscape.

The potential of generating all the specialized cells that make up an organism is referred to as cellular “totipotency”, a concept introduced by the German plant physiologist Haberlandt in the early 1900s. In an attempt to reproduce this mechanism in synthetic organisms, we present a model based on a kind of modular robot called Voxel-based Soft Robot (VSR), where both the body, i.e., the arrangement of voxels, and the brain, i.e., the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) controlling each module, are subject to an evolutionary process aimed at optimizing the locomotion capabilities of the robot. In an analogy between totipotent cells and totipotent ANN-controlled modules, we then include in our model an additional level of adaptation provided by Hebbian learning, which allows the ANNs to adapt their weights during the execution of the locomotion task. Our in silico experiments reveal two main findings. Firstly, we confirm the common intuition that Hebbian plasticity effectively allows better performance and adaptation. Secondly and more importantly, we verify for the first time that the performance improvements yielded by plasticity are in essence due to a form of specialization at the level of single modules (and their associated ANN): thanks to plasticity, modules specialize to react in different ways to the same set of stimuli, i.e., they become functionally and behaviorally different even though their ANN are initialized in the same way. This mechanism, which can be seen as a form of totipotency at the level of ANN, can have, in our view, profound implications in various areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and applications thereof, such as modular robotics and multi-agent systems."},{"n":"28","id":"nadizar2025role","title":"The Role of Stepping Stones in MAP-Elites: Insights from Search Trajectory Networks","author":"G.

While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve high performance in image classification, their opaque decision-making processes, prone to overfitting behavior and dependency on large amounts of annotated data limit their utility in critical fields like digital pathology, where interpretability is essential. To address this, we employ GP, specifically using the Multi-Modal Adaptive Graph Evolution (MAGE) framework, to evolve end-to-end image classification pipelines. We trained MAGE a hundred times with the best optimized key hyperparameters for this task. Among all MAGE models trained, the best one achieved 78% accuracy on the validation set and 76% accuracy on the test set. Among Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our baseline, the best model obtained 84.5% accuracy on the validation set and 77.1% accuracy on the test set. Unlike CNNs, our GP approach enables program-level transparency, facilitating interpretability through example-based reasoning. By analyzing evolved programs with medical experts, we highlight the transparency of decision-making in MAGE pipelines, offering an interpretable alternative for medical image classification tasks where model interpretability is paramount."},{"n":"30","id":"de2025evolution","title":"Evolution of Inherently Interpretable Visual Control Policies","author":"C.

These tasks are often addressed using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to automate sequential decision making. However, the “black-box” nature of ANNs limits their applicability in these settings, where transparency and accountability are essential. To address this, various explanation methods have been proposed; however, they often fall short in fully elucidating the decision-making pipeline of ANNs, a critical aspect for ensuring reliability in safety-critical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose an approach based on Graph-based Genetic Programming (GGP) to generate transparent policies for vision-based control tasks. Our evolved policies are constrained in size and composed of simple and well-understood operational modules, enabling inherent interpretability. We evaluate our method on three Atari games, comparing explanations derived from common explainability techniques to those derived from interpreting the agent’s true computational graph. We demonstrate that interpretable policies offer a more complete view of the decision process than explainability methods, enabling a full comprehension of competitive game-playing policies."},{"n":"31","id":"sakallioglu2025evolving","title":"Evolving Typed Token Processing Networks","author":"B.

A TTPN is a network of interconnected stateless gates defining typed ports and processing functions: during the execution, data flows through the network as typed tokens carrying values. TTPNs favor interpretability as they can visually reveal the overall structure of a program and also highlight the way data is processed at runtime—enabling decomposability and simulatability, respectively. Moreover, like other graph representations, TTPNs enable component reuse. We evolve programs in the form of TTPNs from examples, i.e., we do program synthesis, with a simple genetic algorithm and ad hoc genetic operators. Our preliminary results show successful evolution of simple programs from small example sets involving diverse types, though some instances fail. We hypothesize that the particularly rugged fitness landscape imposed by our representation and, more in general, by the program synthesis scenario, may hinder convergence. We propose some directions for tackling these issues."},{"n":"32","id":"medvet2025quality","title":"Quality-Diversity in Problems with Composite Solutions: a Case Study on Body-Brain Robot Optimization","author":"E.

We call them QD composite problems, and we propose a general formulation for them, as well as a set of indexes useful for comprehensively assessing solutions by measuring both quality and diversity. We experimentally compare a few QD evolutionary algorithms (EAs) on a case study of body-brain optimization of simulated robots, including several variants of MAP-elites (ME), a popular and effective EA for QD. We also propose a novel ME variant, called coevolutionary MAP-elites (CoME), that internally employs two populations, one for each part of the solution, and enforces diversity on them through user-provided descriptors, as the underlying ME does. CoME, instead of blindly combining all the respective parts to obtain full solutions, adopts a specific mapping strategy that is based on the location of each solution part in the respective descriptors space. The results of our comparative analysis show that ME works well in QD composite problems, but only if two archives, instead of just one, are employed, one for each part of the solution. Moreover, we show that the use of multi-archive variants of ME, e.g., CoME, can provide insights on the interplay between the two parts of the solution for the problem at hand, shedding light on key dynamics in co-evolution."},{"n":"33","id":"nadizar2025enhancing","title":"Enhancing Adaptability in Embodied Agents: a Multi-Quality-Diversity Approach","author":"G.

Yet, most robotic agents still suffer from significant performance degradation when scenarios change slightly, with many even failing their tasks entirely. In contrast, organisms in nature exhibit strong adaptability, largely due to bio-diversity, which has prevented the extinction of life throughout severe environmental changes. The concept of quality-diversity aims to emulate this natural resilience, yielding robust results through diversification of embodied agents in the behavior space. However, in nature, diversity occurs simultaneously at multiple levels: body, brain, and behavior. This study on the body-brain optimization of virtual embodied agents spans two brain representations—an artificial neural network (ANN) and a graph—and investigates these levels to determine the most critical scope for diversity in fostering performance, generality, and robustness. We start by optimizing for a simple locomotion task, and then evaluate generality through transfer to a diverse set of tasks, including locomotion in new environments and interaction with objects. Our findings confirm the importance of simultaneously considering multiple axes of diversity for achieving good performance and adaptability—demonstrating zero-shot transfer on 18 new tasks. Moreover, we observe that the graph controller performs on par with the ANN, offering greater interpretability."}]
